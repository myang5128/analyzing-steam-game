CMPU 280 Final Project: Successful Factors of Games Hosted on Steam
================
Michael Yang, Sanjae Chin, Edward Yang

Welcome to our project!!! In this project, we look at factors that can indicate whether or not a game on Steam will be successful. We can define success as the number of players on a given scale (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc). We will be looking at several key factors that can indicate success. These factors include the release data, genre, the publisher/developer/ player count, reviews, ratio of positive and negative reviews, price, playable platforms, most recent update/patch, and whether or not the game is single-player, co-op, or multi-player. Games that are successful have a higher active player count compared to the estimated number of games sold/downloaded.
