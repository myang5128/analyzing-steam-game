<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-and-data">INTRODUCTION AND DATA</h2>
<section id="is-the-research-question-and-goal-of-the-report-clearly-stated" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-the-research-question-and-goal-of-the-report-clearly-stated">Is the research question and goal of the report clearly stated?</h4>
<pre><code>Yes, we were able to identify what the project/report plans on doing, and the goal of the report is to analyze the relationship between the sentiment expressed in FOMC speeches and stock market movements (understanding how market participants react to central bank communication.)</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="does-the-introduction-provide-appropriate-background-context-and-motivation-for-a-general-reader" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="does-the-introduction-provide-appropriate-background-context-and-motivation-for-a-general-reader">Does the introduction provide appropriate background context and motivation for a general reader?</h4>
<pre><code>Yes, it gave a short gist of the Federal Reserve. However, one potential critique would be that the introduction could provide a bit more context on the specific methods Federal Reserve does and its impact on financial markets. For general reader, it is better to explain it a little bit further. </code></pre>
</section>
<section id="is-the-source-of-the-data-stated-with-an-appropriate-citation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-the-source-of-the-data-stated-with-an-appropriate-citation">Is the source of the data stated with an appropriate citation?</h4>
<pre><code>Yes, each source has an appropriate link to where the data can be found and provides a summary of what the data contains (links to data from Yahoo Finance, Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), and the Federal Reserve website are provided)</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="is-it-clear-when-and-how-the-data-was-collected" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-it-clear-when-and-how-the-data-was-collected">Is it clear when and how the data was collected?</h4>
<pre><code>From what we've seen so far, most of the data are public information and acquirable through downloading the data set. The only data that was collected in a different medium were the Federal Reserve speeches which were scraped. It isn't clear when the data was collected or, rather when the public data sets were updated.</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="is-data-manipulation-described-clearly-missing-data-creation-of-new-variables-etc" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-data-manipulation-described-clearly-missing-data-creation-of-new-variables-etc">Is data manipulation described clearly (missing data, creation of new variables, etc)?</h4>
<pre><code>They removed all un-named columns from web scraping, ensured that all dates were in a standard format. Also, they merged different datasets to create a central dataframe.</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="are-the-cases-and-relevant-variables-described" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-the-cases-and-relevant-variables-described">Are the cases and relevant variables described?</h4>
<pre><code>Yes, there is a codebook that lists all the variables used in the analysis along with their descriptions. Additionally, the report discusses the significance of key variables such as stock market indices (e.g., S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq), economic indicators (e.g., unemployment rate, consumer price index), and sentiment analysis from FOMC speeches.</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="methodology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology">METHODOLOGY</h2>
<section id="do-the-visualizations-correspond-to-the-stated-research-question" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-the-visualizations-correspond-to-the-stated-research-question">Do the visualizations correspond to the stated research question?</h4>
<pre><code>We were unable to see two of the graphs (plot-treasury-close-snp-close-plots, plot-finbert-sentiment-snp-high-plot) as there were issues. The other graphs do seem to correspond with their research question. However, through their descriptions of the plots, while the line plots demonstrate correlations between economic indicators and stock market performance, they may lack specificity in addressing the role of FOMC speeches. It would be helpful to incorporate visualizations specifically focused on the time periods surrounding FOMC meetings or speeches to isolate their impact on market movements more directly.</code></pre>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-visualizations-effective-and-do-they-follow-clear-visualization-principles-including-elements-like-titles-labels-appropriate-for-the-type-of-data-etc">Are visualizations effective and do they follow clear visualization principles (including elements like titles, labels, appropriate for the type of data, etc)?</h4>
<pre><code>They were properly labeled and had alt texts.</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="is-the-choice-of-methodapproach-justified" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-the-choice-of-methodapproach-justified">Is the choice of method/approach justified?</h4>
<pre><code>The code mentions the use of machine learning models for sentiment analysis, but it's unclear whether these models have been validated or calibrated on a separate dataset, i.e. test on some training data and test data split from their central dataframe. Also, it seems to me that they've hold several assumptions and simplifications, such as treating all FOMC speeches as equally impactful and assuming linear relationships between variables, which may oversimplify the problem. They might need discuss it.</code></pre>
